/* ANALYSIS

3 3       N=3 sections of speed limit data, M=3 sections of tractor speed data
40 75     40 miles of speed limit 75mph
50 35     50 miles of speed limit 35mph
10 45     10 miles speed limit 45mph

40 76     40 miles where tractor drove 76mph
20 30     20 miles where tractor drove 30mph
40 40     40 miles where tractor drove 40mph

FOR NEXT TIME: propose a way to picture this data clearly so we can see
    how the answer can be determined
