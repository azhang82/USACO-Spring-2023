			// Focus is on 1d arrays and loops
		
			// Basics of Java
					// Looping
					// Indexing
					// Meaningful Indices
						// int[] is used as a "counting checklist:
						// boolean[] is used as a checklist
					// Using the efficient lookup of arrays
						// If some part of a problem gives us info that lets us focus on one index,
						// it is very fast to jump to that index
					// Nested loops
						// some kind of combination
						// adding values from an inner loop to create one result for each outer loop cycle
						// important to think carefully about what updates are made at what levels 
							// backforth problem needed undoing in variables
					// relative indexing
						// lots of ideas about distance and movement on indices
						// movement along an array with + or - indices
					// circular indexing
						// can do this with % and with if statemenets
						// idea that when you get to the end of the loop, you return to the beginning
					// Parallel arrays
						// index i of one array is used with index i of another array
						// better solution than using nested arrays
